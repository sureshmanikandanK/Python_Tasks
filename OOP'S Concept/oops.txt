Our program around functions i.e Blocks of statements that manipulate data. This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming.
There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object . This is called as object oriented programming language.

OOP'S concept:
Class
object
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Inheritance 
Data Abstraction

class:
Class is a collection of objects
A Class is a blueprint for how something should be defined
Class define the functions called methods,which identify the behaviours that an object created from the classes can perform with its data

Objects:
Objects are anything that has properties and some behaviours
Properties of objects - variables
Behaviours - functions of the Objects
The properties that all objects have are defined in a method called __init__()
__init__ sets the initial state of the object

Property() - method is a inbuilt function
Allows us to create a special type of attribute called a Property for a class
Way to manage attribute access encapsulation and validation within the class
The property() function can be used instead of the @property decorator to achive same functionality

syntax
property(fget=none,fset=none,fdet=none,doc=none,)

fget-to get the value
fset-to set the value
fdet-to delete the attribute
doc-string that serve as a documentation for the attribute
