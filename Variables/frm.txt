->map, filter and reduce are paradigms of functional programming
-> map and filter come built-in with python(built-in functions)
reduce, needs to be imported as it resides in the functools module
->syntax
filter(function, iterable)
->function: it tests if each element of a sequence True or Not I
->sequence which needs to be filtered, it can be list, sets, tuples or containers of any iteration


->Landa function (Amomymus Function) -> function without a name
-> this function can take any number of arguments but only one expression,which is evaluated and returned

Syntax :lamda arguments:expression

map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results
after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable(list,tuples etc)
or allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable
without using an explicit for loop , a technique commonly known as mapping

syntax : 
map(function,iterable,[iterable1,iterable2......])
